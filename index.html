<div class="dads-intro">
    <p>Hi, <a href='https://neilpahl.com'>Neil</a> here. Elliot and Valerie are 5 & 3 at the moment, but I hope that <a href='https:/pahl.hk'>pahl.hk</a> can be hacked on by them as soon as they begin to read/write.</p> 
    <p>For now, if they create anything which they are particularly proud of, I will help them showcase it on this domain. When they are able, I hope we can all collaborate on things, showcasing them here. &#128578;</p>
